![Pic. 8. Localization Component](/assets/images/projects/easy-assets-localize/localization-component-view.jpg?raw=true "Pic. 8. Localization Component")
<center>For localization to change the resources of an object, add the object to the list of handlers and select the property corresponding to the resource type (usually they are at the top of the drop-down list)</center>

![Pic. 9. Add handler](/assets/images/projects/easy-assets-localize/add-handler.jpg?raw=true "Pic. 9. Add handler")

The component that appears will reference the default localization. To change localization, click the `Change Localization` button.

<center>In the list that appears, you can select an existing localization or add a new one.<center>

The new localization will link to the same resources as the standard one. They can be changed directly on the component.

> Attention! The changes will affect all objects using an instance of this localization.
